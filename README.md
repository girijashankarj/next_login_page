# Next.js Login Form

## Overview

This project showcases the development of a login page using a modern tech stack. The key components include:

Next.js: Utilized for building a robust and efficient React application with server-side rendering capabilities, enhancing performance and SEO.

Chakra UI: Integrated for seamless and customizable styling, with a focus on demonstrating multiple variant input fields and button styles to enhance the overall user interface.

Storybook: Employed for component development, allowing for isolated testing and documentation of UI components. This enhances the development workflow and promotes component reusability.

React Hook Form: Implemented for efficient form handling, improving the user experience in the login page by providing a reliable and responsive form submission process.

By combining these technologies, the project not only creates a functional login page but also serves as an educational resource for developers interested in leveraging Next.js, Chakra UI, Storybook, and React Hook Form in their projects. The emphasis on variant styles and efficient form handling demonstrates best practices for creating a dynamic and user-friendly web application.
