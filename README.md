# next_login_page
This project highlights my skills in creating a login page using React.js, Node.js, and JavaScript. I've styled it with Chakra UI, developed components with Storybook, and ensured smooth form handling using React Hook Form. It's a demonstration of my ability to build user-friendly interfaces in a product-based setting.
